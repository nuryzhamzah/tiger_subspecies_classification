# 🐯 Tiger Species Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model developed to identify different tiger species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It was built as part of our Artificial Intelligence coursework at Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL MIIT).

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Tiger Species Image Classification
- **University**: UniKL MIIT
- **Course**: ISB46703 Principles of Artificial Intelligence
- **Group Name**: RAWRR
- **Semester**: March 2025
- **Model Used**: CNN (ResNet50, MobileNetV3, DenseNet121 )

## 📌 Objectives

- Train a classification model to distinguish tiger subspecies.
- Apply transfer learning with pre-trained CNN architectures.
- Evaluate model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and loss.
- Deploy the model in a notebook environment (Jupyter / Colab).
